<p class="centered"> 
    Dog breeds are some of the most important aspects of what dog to choose.
    Dog races have similarities in how a dog looks, acts and how intelligent they are. Some people 
    therefore like different types of dogs! These preferenses can go from liking your dog to do tricks, 
    and therefore choosing a smarter one, to liking an athletic dog that can compete in agility for you! 
    But most people like a dog that you can cuddle with, that likes you and that people can enjoy their company with.
    This list is for having a family dog, so these 3 dog breeds are not necesarily chosen for their exeptional ability 
    in anything but as a family friend.

<h1 class="centeredtitle">Labrador Retrievers</h1>
 
<p class="centered">
    The sweet-faced, lovable Labrador Retriever is America's most popular dog breed. Labs are friendly, 
    outgoing, and high-spirited companions who have more than enough affection to go around for a family 
    looking for a medium-to-large dog. The sturdy, well-balanced Labrador Retriever can, depending on the sex, 
    stand from 21.5 to 24.5 inches at the shoulder and weigh between 55 to 80 pounds. The dense, hard coat 
    comes in yellow, black, and a luscious chocolate. The head is wide, the eyes glimmer with kindliness, 
    and the thick, tapering 'otter tail' seems to be forever signaling the breed's innate eagerness. Labs 
    are famously friendly. They are companionable housemates who bond with the whole family, and they socialize 
    well with neighbor dogs and humans alike. But don't mistake his easygoing personality for low energy. The Lab
    is an enthusiastic athlete that requires lots of exercise, like swimming and marathon games of fetch, to 
    keep physically and mentally fit. This dog is for the more sporty families who likes to go out and have fun in 
    the sun.

<h1 class="centeredtitle">Cocker Spaniel</h1>
 

<p class="centered">
    The merry and frolicsome Cocker Spaniel, with his big, dreamy eyes and impish personality, is one of the
     world's best-loved breeds. They were developed as hunting dogs, but Cockers gained their wide popularity 
     as all-around companions. Those big dark eyes, that sweet expression, those long lush ears that 
     practically demand to be touched, no wonder the Cocker spent years as America's most popular breed. 
     The Cocker is the AKC's smallest sporting spaniel, standing about 14 to 15 inches. The coat comes in 
     enough colors and patterns to please any taste. The well-balanced body is sturdy and solid, and these 
     quick, durable gundogs move with a smooth, easy gait. Cockers are eager playmates for kids and are easily 
     trained as companions and athletes. They are big enough to be sporty, but compact enough to be portable. A 
     Cocker in full coat rewards extra grooming time by being the prettiest dog on the block. These energetic 
     sporting dogs love playtime and brisk walks. The cocker spaniels are for the people who like a mix of calm
     and energetic dogs.

<h1 class="centeredtitle">Tibetan Spaniel</h1>

<p class="centered">
    The frisky and curious Tibetan Spaniel was bred ages ago for sentinel work on the walls of Tibetan monasteries.
     Known for a flat, silky coat and 'lion's mane' around the neck, the Tibbie forms a tight, worshipful bond 
     with their humans. With a blunt muzzle and big expressive eyes, a 'lion's mane' around the neck, and a 
     plumed tail elegantly curving over the back, they're distinctly Tibetan. But are they spaniels? No, not in 
     the Western sense, like Cockers or Cavaliers. Instead, Tibbies recall the ancient traditions that produced 
     Pekes, Pugs, Lhasas, and other unmistakably Asian breeds. Tibbies stand about 10 inches at the shoulder. They
      move quickly and with purpose. They're seen in coats of many colors and combinations. Perfect for a family 
      that loves attention.
